# CodSoft_TaskNo.1
Movie Genre Classification using different methods. Working on a Kaggle dataset. 

Link to the dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb

Here, since some of the genres have more weightage in the dataset i.e. due to imbalance in the dataset (both train and test sets), the accuracy is very high but the precision, recall and f1 scores are low for the genres with low weightage. Since the test set is not supposed to be resampled, hence, the imbalance is the cause of low scores but quite high accuracy.
